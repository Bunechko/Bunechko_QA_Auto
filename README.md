# Automated Testing Framework

This framework serves as a ready-made solution for implementing automated testing using the Python programming language.

## Project Overview

In the context of the course project, the code and tests from educational materials were inherited, and additional tests were developed. The following types of tests were created: HTTPS, API, Database, and UI.

## API Testing

API testing is covered by independent tests located in the file "test_github_api.py," marked with the comment: "Project task 4. Module 27. API testing." These tests can be executed separately using the "api" marker.

## Database Testing

For database testing, standalone tests are available in the file "test_database.py," marked with the comment: "Project task 5. Module 28. SQL." These tests can be run individually using the "database" marker.

## UI Testing

UI testing is carried out through independent tests present in the files "test_tracking_meest.py" and "test_ui_iherb.py." These tests utilize custom page objects defined in "tracking_meest.py" and "buy_product_iherb.py" respectively. Execute these tests separately using the "meest" and "iherb" markers, corresponding to the specific tests.

Feel free to explore and enhance this framework for your automated testing needs.
